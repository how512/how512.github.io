every day i see more and more comments like
"man, wish i discovered this before it blew up on tiktok",
why
why are you envious that more people have discovered something.
oh, now you're not that unique for enjoying said thing, now everyone knows about it, oh what a shame
also it looks like you also discovered it through or with help of tiktok
stop gatekeeping, it shouldn't make you feel bad or "less special"
