every day i see more and more comments like
"man, wish i discovered this before it blew up on tiktok"
<br>
why 
<br>
why are you envious that more people have discovered something
<br>
oh, now you're not that unique for enjoying said thing, now everyone knows about it, oh what a shame 
<br>
also it looks like you also discovered it through or with help of tiktok 
<br>
stop gatekeeping, it shouldn't make you feel bad or "less special"
