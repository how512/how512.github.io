# the internet I miss 

_that_ internet,

one, where, i don't have to worry about something suddenly being ai, <br>
without a warning, <br>
it's a tool, dammit, not a replacement <br>
not a replacement for your creativity, <br>
all those texts tend to be same-y, <br>
generic fucking empty flowery shit,

some are not empty, you can see the original text (sbhdjdbs?-ing) through that sloppy LLM writing, <br>
you can see a person seeking to improve their language, getting left with a "line of best fit", <br>
not an improvement, a change, and not a good one

the other thing is organic discovery, where is it, <br>
all major social media platforms are ran by big corporations, <br>
most of them have algorithmic feeds <br>
<p style="text-align: center;">to keep the users engaged,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">to show more ads, </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">to make more money,</p>


as you may infer this gives said corporations full control over what content you see

user is not the main focus, money is, <br>
unless, <br>
changing the perception of the masses could also be useful, hmmmmmmm

mmmmmm, promoting the ragebait as it drives more clicks

---

**what can you do?**

first of all, <br>
start small, <br>
many apps have "not interested" button, 
shape the feed to what you really want to see, <br>
this won't give you back the control, but, at least you can steer it in the right direction

while on the phone, <br>
(if you have an android), <br>
you should try <h2><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.flx_apps.digitaldetox/", style="font-size: 36px;">DetoxDroid</a>, while tricky to set up, <br>
it has some amazing features,<br>
with one of them being doomscrolling detection, <br>
when caught, it will offer you a way out, <br>
great stuff, <br>
if you can, definitely check it out

three, <br>
think, <br>
do you really need a content to be picked out for you, <br>
who makes this content? <br>
people <br>
,who post it on the community, <br>
are you interested? , <br>
then look inside, <br>
talk, find interesting people, find new connections, <br>
unless it's an LLM, then don't bother, <br>
if not person spent their time on the content, why should you give it yours

i'm out
