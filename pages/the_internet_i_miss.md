# the internet I miss 

_that_ internet,

one where I don't have to worry about something suddenly being ai, without a warning, 
it's a tool, dammit, not a replacement
not a replacement for your creativity,
all those texts tend to be same-y,
generic fucking empty flowery shit,

some are not empty, you can see the original text (sbhdjdbs?-ing) through that sloppy LLM writing,
you can see a person seeking to improve their language, getting left with a "line of best fit",
not an improvement, a change, and not a good one

the other thing is organic discovery, where is it,
all major social media platforms are ran by big corporations,
most of them have algorithmic feeds
<p style="text-align: center;">to keep the users engaged,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">to show more ads, </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">to make more money,</p>


as you may infer this gives said corporations full control over what content you see

user is not the main focus, money is,
unless,
changing the perception of the masses could also be useful, hmmmmmmm

mmmmmm, promoting the ragebait as it drives more clicks

---

**what can you do?**

first of all, 
start small, 
many apps have "not interested" button, 
shape the feed to what you really want to see,
this won't give you back the control, but, at least you can steer it in the right direction

while on the phone, 
(if you have an android), 
you should try <h2>[DetoxDroid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.flx_apps.digitaldetox/)</h2>, while tricky to set up,
it has some amazing features,
with one of them being doomscrolling detection, 
when caught, it will offer you a way out,
great stuff,
if you can, definitely check it out

three,
think,
do you really need a content to be picked out for you, 
who makes this content?
people
,who post it on the community,
are you interested? , 
then look inside, 
talk, find interesting people, find new connections,
unless it's an LLM, then don't bother, 
if not person spent their time on the content, why should you give it yours

i'm out
